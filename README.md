============

Patient Proxy is a web app that helps users generate living will documents.

This was my first major undertaking in PHP web development. I did not use any php framework. I used [maphilight](http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/) to make the map of the US highlight and selectable; I used [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle payments; and I used [fpdf](http://www.fpdf.org) to help generate the output pdf at the end.
